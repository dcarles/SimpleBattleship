The Problem

Implement a very simple game of battle ships. If you’ve never played the game, you can get a feel for it from the links in the reference section. You should create a simple console application to allow a single human player to play a one-sided game of battleships against the computer. The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place a number of ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:

● 1x Battleship (5 squares)

● 2x Destroyers (4 squares)

The console application should accept input from the user in the format “A5” to signify a square to target, and feedback to the user whether the shot was success, and additionally report on the sinking of any vessels.
